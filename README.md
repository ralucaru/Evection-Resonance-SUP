The repository contains the numerical data presented in Figures 6 and 8 

Description:
Final angular momentum values after the lunar passage through evection resonance and the subsequent quasi-resonance (QR) for the non-synchronous lunar spin cases. Qeff /k2⊕, Earth’s tidal dissipation parameter (column #1); A, the relative tidal strength factor (column #2);  L_final_QR, the normalized minimum final AM in each combination, obtained in the simulations that exited on the QR side (column #3, also described in Fig. 6 and 8); L_final_NonQR , the normalized minimum final AM in each combination, obtained in the simulations that exited on the non-QR side (column #4); Fra_cQR, the fraction of simulations that exited the resonance on the QR side (column #5). NaN values in column #3 [#4] depict cases where a QR [non-QR] evolution did not occur.
